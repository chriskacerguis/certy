# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I actively maintain the **`main`** branch, and I update this repo when new features are added (and I let dependabot do its thing).

Older tags/releases may not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project:

- **Please open a GitHub Issue** in this repository describing the problem.  
- Do not include sensitive details or exploits in the issue itself. Instead, provide enough information for me to reproduce the problem in a safe way.  
- I will review the report promptly and follow up as needed.

## Notes

- This project is provided as-is.  
- I really appreciate community contributions to help keep it secure.  
- If you are unsure whether something is a security issue or a regular bug, itâ€™s fine to open an issue and I will triage it appropriately.
